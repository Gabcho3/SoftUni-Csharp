            Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions.
            Small minds will always do that, but great minds will give you a
            feeling that you can become great too.

          Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The
          ability to direct individual accomplishments toward organizational
          objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain
          uncommon results. Individual commitment to a group effortâ€”that is what
          makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilisation
          work.

            Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of
            self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best
            of which you are capable.
